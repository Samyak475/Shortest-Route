# Shortest Route  Finder 
<h4>
The project is a web application that helps electric vehicle (EV) drivers find the shortest and most energy-efficient route between two points. The user enters the origin and destination points, and the application uses the Google Geocoding API to fetch the geo-spatial coordinates of these points. It then uses these coordinates to calculate the shortest route between the two points using Dijkstra's algorithm. The user can select the network type (e.g., walk, drive, bike) and the map type (e.g., terrain, satellite, hybrid) to display the shortest routes on.
Here is an example of how the project can be used. An EV driver wants to find the shortest and most energy-efficient route from their home to work. They enter their home and work addresses into the application, and the application calculates the shortest route using Dijkstra's algorithm. The application then displays the shortest route on a map, along with the estimated travel time and energy consumption. The driver can then choose to follow the route that is most energy-efficient, or they can choose to follow the route that is fastest.




<h4>
The Output of the project is K optimal (shortest Path )Between the source and destination provided by user.

<h4>
The Key Implementation of this project are :
<li>The project uses the Google Geocoding API to fetch the geo-spatial coordinates of the locations entered by the user. 
<li>The user can select the network type (e.g., walk, drive, bike) and the algorithm type (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-ford algorithm) to use for calculating the shortest routes.
